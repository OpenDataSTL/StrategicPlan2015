##Group Description
OpenDataSTL is a group is for champions, advocates, innovators, and practitioners of open data, open government, and civic technology in the Saint Louis region.

There are roles for developers, designers, technologists, journalists, bureaucrats, policy wonks, and anyone else who wants to contribute to the policy implementation, software development, advocacy, and just plain hard work of advancing the state of open data and civic technology in Saint Louis.

OpenDataSTL grew out of the June 2013 Random Hacks of Kindness STL, which was part of the 2013 National Day of Civic Hacking Event. Civic hacks and open data planning are regular activities of this group.  In June 2014, OpenDataSTL became the local Saint Louis Code for America brigade.

##Strategy & Tactics

What strategy and tactics will you use to execute on your goals for the year? A timeline can be a useful way to demonstrate this.

Many of our goals will be advanced during and through events and hack days.

###Draft Events Timeline
####January  
+ Health Hack Weekend: Partnering with the City of St. Louis Health Department to hold a "scatterjam" style hack weekend to redeploy existing Code for America health-related apps as well as create new health-related tools.  
+ Global Game Jam: Sending a team to the Saint Louis site for the Global Game Jam, with the intention of creating a video game based on an opensource dataset. The hope is to use this as a means to increase awareness of the organization and opensource principles.

##Draft Budget


For 2015, Code for America anticipates it can offer Official Brigade Chapters a budget of $5,500 in support. **Note: this amount will be pro-rated throughout the year based on when a group joins.**  

Please draft a budget for how your group will spend this $5,500. The budget should map to the goals in your strategic plan.  
   
Areas where Brigades often spend money include:  
  
* regular events, like weekly hack nights and Meetups
  - 12 meetups
  - 12 (?) work nights
  - Include editathons here
  - Food and some material costs
  - Assume no space costs

* large events, like CodeAcross, National Day of Civic Hacking, or CityCamp
  - food, beverage, space, material supplies, speakers, prizes, etc.
  - Planning to eliminate prizes
  - CodeAcross will just be food costs
  - Budget Build4STL last, and max out budget
  - See below for additional events

* development and launch of app/projects
  - Should be mostly hosting costs
  - Perhaps some promotional costs?

* hosting, marketing materials, etc.
  - Need estimate on hosting costs for apps
  - Domain registration (Brett will get quote)
  - Twitter/facebook advertising
