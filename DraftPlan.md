##Group Description
OpenDataSTL is a group is for champions, advocates, innovators, and practitioners of open data, open government, and civic technology in the Saint Louis region.

There are roles for developers, designers, technologists, journalists, bureaucrats, policy wonks, and anyone else who wants to contribute to the policy implementation, software development, advocacy, and just plain hard work of advancing the state of open data and civic technology in Saint Louis.

OpenDataSTL grew out of the June 2013 Random Hacks of Kindness STL, which was part of the 2013 National Day of Civic Hacking Event. Civic hacks and open data planning are regular activities of this group.  In June 2014, OpenDataSTL became the local Saint Louis Code for America brigade.

In addition to this draft plan, please also refer to our list brainstormed goals, strategies, tactics, and potential new partnerships ranked by the number of votes from OpenDataSTL members present at our December 30, 2014 meeting: https://github.com/OpenDataSTL/StrategicPlan2015/blob/master/brainstorming.md

##Goals for 2015

Based the OpenDataSTL strategic plan brainstorming/prioritizing meeting held December 30, 2014 (full idea list here: https://github.com/OpenDataSTL/StrategicPlan2015/blob/master/brainstorming.md), the following are core goals for 2015. 
*Note: OpenDataSTL will continue to refine and revisit our goals based on brigade member input, especially during the month of January 2015*

+ Increase the impact of the Build4STL hackathon, our biggest annual event
+ Advance the state of Open Data in Saint Louis and open 25+ datasets
+ Determine a process for annual brigade leadership elections & leadership transition
+ Improve both internal and external communications
+ Grow and diversify OpenDataSTL membership and partnerships 
  *Note: this goal was identified prior to the Build4STL strategic planning meeting and, as such, brainstorming focused on strategies and tactics to achieve this goal, as well as potential partnerships*

OpenDataSTL's goals for 2015 relate to all 7 of Code for America's Principles for 21st Century Governments (listed below).  Given our focus this year on communications, growth/diversity/inclusion/partnerships, opening new datasets and increasing the impact of Build4STL, the principles that especially align with our 2015 Strategic Plan include "2. Make it easy for everyone to participate", "4. Make data easy to find and use", and "7. Organize for results."

###Code for America Principles for 21st Century Governments 
1. Design for people's needs
2. Make it easy for everyone to participate
3. Focus on what government can do
4. Make data easy to find and use
5. Use data to make and improve decisions
6. Choose the right technology for the job
7. Organize for results

----------

##Strategy & Tactics

Many of our goals will be advanced during and through events.  In addition to the events and major milestones listed below, OpenDataSTL holds regular monthly meetings and monthly Saturday "hack/work days."  Finally, there are some overarching and overlapping values OpenDataSTL has identified for 2015: namely improving internal and external communications, growing and diversifying our membership, and forging new partnerships.  Clear, compelling communication, inclusion, and partnership will be critical to the success of all of the events listed below, and OpenDataSTL will work on ways to evaluate our performance on these issues.

----------

###Draft Events & Milestones Timeline  
  
####January  
+ Health Hack Weekend: Partnering with the City of St. Louis Health Department to hold a "scatterjam" style hack weekend to redeploy existing Code for America health-related apps as well as create new health-related tools.  
+ Global Game Jam: Sending a team to the Saint Louis site for the Global Game Jam, with the intention of creating a video game based on an opensource dataset. The hope is to use this as a means to increase awareness of the organization and opensource principles.  
+ Launch new OpenDataSTL website (Jekyll, GitHub Pages) - to be improved on throughout the year
  
####February  
+ CodeAcross: Datathon - A hackathon that focuses on the creation and analysis of open datasets. Expenses Include: Food and Drinks, Marketing, Space Reservations, Prizes?  
  
####March  
+ FOIA Day (in partnership with the St. Louis Public Library)
  
####April  
+ OpenStreetMap Mapathon
+ Nominations for 2015-2016 leadership team

####May  
+ BuildforSTL ramp-up events, including trainings, data scavenger hunt, and more
+ Elections of 2015-2016 leadership team

####June  
+ BuildforSTL: BuildforSTL is OpenDataSTL's National Day of Civic Hacking event. Last year, it cost ~$15k, paid for by 3rd party sponsors. We would like to grow this event this year by moving most of the activities to earlier in the month in order to drive participation for the hackathon.   
+ OpenStreetMap State of the Map US: OpenDataSTL has many members who edit and/or use OpenStreetMap. Considering organizing a group to go together to the SOTMUS conference June 6-8 in NYC  
+ Announcement of 2015-2016 leadership team
  
####July  
+ Government Document Designathon  
  
####August

##Outcomes

+ Ideally, new open data policies implemented by City of St Louis and St Louis County.  (Much of our work is related to education and demonstration about why Open Data matters.)
+ At least 25 new datasets made open due to the efforts of OpenDataSTL
+ Events held, apps deployed, and projects completed that reflect the leadership and values of a more diverse OpenDataSTL membership (skillsets, backgrounds, genders, races/ethnicities, geographies, incomes) 
+ Additional partnerships with local governments, community not-for-profits, and private sector companies
+ Additional influence (perhaps measured via social media follows, web analytics, etc.) due to improved communication and messaging

Our meetups will be used primarily for brigade planning and collaboration. These meetups are critical to capacity building, communication, and creating an inclusive environment.  
The meetups will also be the space we use to welcome new partners and introduce them our work.  
New for 2015 will be monthly work days where we will spend up to 8 hrs working away at new datasets and apps.  
The workdays will be critical to reaching our goal of opening 25 new datasets.  
We will also continue our collboration with MaptimeSTL to put on quarterly OpenStreetMap Editathons. These events are extremely popular and serve as great outreach to specific neighborhoods.  
  
28 total events

###Large events  
The large events are critical to recruitment but also are where we truly develop brigade leadership and spread the cause of civic technology.  
As in 2014, our central event will be BuildForSTL, but we also intend to expand our participation in CodeAcross and add FOIA Day to our event calendar.  
  
####CodeAcross: Target of 50 participants  
CodeAcross this year will be a datathon where we work primarily on freeing datasets as well as bringing in experts from partners for education sessions on specific datasets.  
No space costs anticipated  
Advertising: $200.00 (Facebook/Twitter)  
Food/Drinks: $300.00  
Supplies: $100.00  
**Event Total: $600.00**  
  
####FOIA Day: Target 50 participants at main library event

Supplies: $100.00  
**Event Total: $100.00**  
  
####Ramp up to Build For STL  
We plan to host events throughout the month leading to National Day of Civic Hacking. Though we intend to get third party sponsors, we anticipate food costs for some events.  
~20 events with additional food costs for ~4 at $60/event.   
Food/drink: $240.00  
**Event Total: $240.00**  
  
####BuildForSTL (National Day of Civic Hacking): Target of 500 participants  
Once again we anticipate recruiting significant third party sponsors for BuildForSTL. We have a few sponsorship roles specific to Code for America though.  
Unlike last year, we will likely eliminate prizes and focus more on community results than competition.  
For CfA's role, we would like to have CfA sponsor two event food breaks.  
Like last year, we woudl like in kind support from CfA to provide from staff/fellow or recruit speakers from other organizations (with costs for those speakers covered by other sponsors).  
Code for America would also serve as an event space sponsor. This would likely not cover the entire space costs, but would be a significant start on those costs.  
Speakers: In kind support to provide/recruit speakers  
Advertising: $500.00  
Two CfA-sponsored food breaks: $600.00 @ $300 ea.  
Event Space: $1000.00  
**Event Total: $2100.00**
