##Goals for 2015
What does your Brigade want to get done this year? If you’re seeking support as an Official Brigade Chapter, your strategy needs to map to one or more of the Code for America Principles for 21st Century Governments.

##Strategy & Tactics
What strategy and tactics will you use to execute on your goals for the year? A timeline can be a useful way to demonstrate this.
##Outcomes
What are the outcomes you’ll see if you’re successful?
	
##Draft Budget

For 2015, Code for America anticipates it can offer Official Brigade Chapters a budget of $5,500 in support. **Note: this amount will be pro-rated throughout the year based on when a group joins.**  
  
Please draft a budget for how your group will spend this $5,500. The budget should map to the goals in your strategic plan.  
   
Areas where Brigades often spend money include:  
  
* regular events, like weekly hack nights and Meetups
  - 12 meetups
  - 12 (?) work nights
  - Include editathons here
  - Food and some material costs
  - Assume no space costs

* large events, like CodeAcross, National Day of Civic Hacking, or CityCamp
  - food, beverage, space, material supplies, speakers, prizes, etc.
  - Planning to eliminate prizes
  - CodeAcross will just be food costs
  - Budget Build4STL last, and max out budget
  - See below for additional events

* development and launch of app/projects
  - Should be mostly hosting costs
  - Perhaps some promotional costs?

* hosting, marketing materials, etc.
  - Need estimate on hosting costs for apps
  - Domain registration (Brett will get quote)
  - Twitter/facebook advertising
