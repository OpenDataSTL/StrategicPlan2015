##Goals for 2015
What does your Brigade want to get done this year? If you’re seeking support as an Official Brigade Chapter, your strategy needs to map to one or more of the Code for America Principles for 21st Century Governments.
##Strategy & Tactics
What strategy and tactics will you use to execute on your goals for the year? A timeline can be a useful way to demonstrate this.
##Outcomes

##Draft Budget

For 2015, Code for America anticipates it can offer Official Brigade Chapters a budget of $5,500 in support. **Note: this amount will be pro-rated throughout the year based on when a group joins.**

Please draft a budget for how your group will spend this $5,500. The budget should map to the goals in your strategic plan.
 
Areas where Brigades often spend money include:

regular events, like weekly hack nights and Meetups

food, beverage, space, material supplies, etc.

large events, like CodeAcross, National Day of Civic Hacking, or CityCamp

food, beverage, space, material supplies, speakers, prizes, etc.

development and launch of app/projects

hosting, marketing materials, etc.
